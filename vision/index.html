            <h2>From The Principal's Desk </h2>
            <p>"The instantaneous aim of the education is to prepare the students for their actual life. Education in its real sense is development within and action outside. The core of it is not transmitting information but transforming human personality. This, as exemplified by Sri Aurobindo involves physical, vital, mental, psychological and spiritual aspects. Echoing similar sentiments Swami Vivekananda considered education essential for the entire universe".</p>

                <p>An educational institute is not just a place to impart knowledge, but it is a place of formation of young minds. I am very happy that Philomena College, Puttur is completed 60 fruitful years of existence and meritorious service to the society in the academic year 2018-19. Ever since its establishment the College has made remarkable progress in providing quality education to students without any discrimination.</p>
